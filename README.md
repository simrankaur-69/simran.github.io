## MBA Student, Finance Student, Would-be Banking Analyst.

I will be an MBA student at University Canada West (2024-2026) who has a solid academic and professional background in finance, equity research and investment analysis. My professional experience indicates a combination of analytical skills and customer-oriented service experience that will lead me to make a shift to the Canadian banking industry.

My background includes working as an Equity Research Analyst at Morningstar in Mumbai (20202024) where I performed basic company analysis, developed a financial model based on DCF and other similar valuation methods, and made contributions to institutional and retail investor investment research reports. Necessary for my role were strict financial statement analysis, macroeconomic evaluation and investment decisions based on data.

Now, I am employed at Starbucks in Vancouver as a Barista, and I have enhanced my communication, flexibility and interaction with customers in a highly dynamic setting. This has not only contributed to my knowledge about service excellence, which is a very fundamental skill in retail and commercial banking, but also in commercial banking in general.

To support the startup valuation and revenue prediction, I developed a structured financial projections template that is designed to support the process in Lovely Professional University (India) in 2020 (I received my Bachelor of Business Administration). I am also dedicated to life long learning, both academically and professionally. I am a CFA Level I candidate and I am undertaking the Canadian Securities Course (CSC) to make my qualification in line with the financial industry standards of Canada.

I am seeking an opportunity to be placed in a banking or financial analyst position in Vancouver where I can be able to apply analytical rigor, strategic acumen and high quality client relationship management to add value to financial decisions and long term value creation.
